Official code repository for: SwinV2-SF: A Parallel Polyp Segmentation Architecture Leveraging Swin Transformer V2 and Spatial-Frequency Dual-Domain Attention
## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Abstract
We propose SwinV2-SF, a novel hybrid neural network for colorectal polyp segmentation. This architecture integrates the spatial-frequency dual-domain network SFUNet with Swin Transformer V2, achieving semantic alignment between frequency and spatial domain features to enable holistic consideration of polyp features.
